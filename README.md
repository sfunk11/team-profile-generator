  ## Installation
  This application is run in Node.js.  To install, please download the files from the repository and run “npm i” from the command line to install the dependencies.  
  
  ## Usage
  Once installed, you trigger the program at your command line with the command: “node app.js”.  The application will prompt you for information about each team member, allowing you to enter as many as you would like. A table will show your full team after each entry is completed.  Once you are done, a "team.html" file will be generated.
